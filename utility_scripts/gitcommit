#This is a cronjob that I run locally
#to automate committing to various projects
#obviously replace/edit to suit your needs


#!/bin/bash
pushd /PATH/TO/A/GIT/REPO
/PATH/TO//git commit -a -m "15 min auto commit"

#repeat above pattern.  A nice thing would be to 
#create a script that takes input and appends
#to this file and perhaps even deletes an entry
#when/if a project is removed
